# hoplite

Hoplite is a Kotlin library for loading configuration files. It reads Typesafe Config configurations written in HOCON, Java .properties, Yaml or JSON to Kotlin classes in a boilerplate-free way. Sealed classes, data classes, collections, nullable values, and many other types are all supported out-of-the-box. Users also have many ways to add support for custom types or customize existing ones.
